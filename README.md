Figma-Your-Life
I made 3 pages, I used a nav bar and made plenty of .cols and .rows

Comments: This is pretty neat dude, I think the choice of images is cool and they are all cohesive, I like how on the third page it fits the figma almost exactly. The only thing I would suggest is making the text bigger to match the figma, other than that its solid. Good Job.
